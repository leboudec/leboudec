<img src="./images/simjardoshlogo.gif" height=288 width=288>

<p>Welcome to the random trip mobility model page. You will find here a description of the model and ns-2 code to use it in simulations.



<p>The random trip model is a generic mobility model that generalizes random waypoint and random walk to realistic scenarios. 
You can use it to give a realistic flavour to your simulations. It is implemented in ns-2 and can be used without license. 
The implementation performs perfect initialization, i.e. the mobility model has no transient phase.

<h3>The Random Trip Models</h3>

The Random Trip Models, a wide class of mobility models, contain many existing mobility models in one, plus some new ones. 
Examples include random waypoint on 
general connected domain, restricted random waypoint, and random walk models with either wrap-around or reflection.

(to appear); <a href="http://ic2.epfl.ch/publications/abstract.php?ID=200459">pdf</a>.
</ul>

If well-defined, random trip models feature:

<ul>
<li> Existence of a unique steady-state distribution
<li> Perfect simulation is easy to do
<ul>
<li> No need to know geometric normalization constants when they are difficult to compute -- bound on diameter of the mobility domain suffices
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>ns-2 code</h3>

Code to use random trip with ns-2 network simulator is freely available from:

<ul>
<li> <img src="./images/uc_new18.gif"> available soon: <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~santa/research/mobility/tbd">ns-2 code</a>, by S. PalChaudhuri, Rice University.
</ul>

The code includes the model with <i>perfect sampling</i>, i.e. the initial mobility state can be set in steady state at the beginning
of the simulation, so that annoying transient artifacts are avoided.

<h3>Importance of perfect mobility simulations</h3>

<ul>
<li> Transient phase may last as long as a typical simulation run ! <a href="transience.htm"> see mobility transience </a>
<li> Perfect mobility simulation may reduce transience of a studied protocol. <a href="dsr.htm"> see DSR transience</a>
</ul>

Advent of random waypoint model: "Each host is initially placed at a random position within in the simulation area. 
As the simulation progresses, each host pauses at its current location for a period, which we call the <i>pause time</i>, and then randomly chooses a new 
location to move to and a velocity between 0.3 and 0.7 meters per second at which to move there. Each host continues this behavior, alternately pausing 
and moving to a new location, for the duration of the simulation."
