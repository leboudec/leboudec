<h1> Is transience of a protocol shorter, if the mobility simulation is perfect ? </h1>

<b>Example</b>: DSR

<p>

The mobility model is restricted random-waypoint on <a href="./catalog.htm#houston">Houston section</a>. There are 50 mobiles. At a trip transition instant, 
if phase is move, numerical speed is drawn at random, uniformly on the interval [0.01,9.99]. 
Else, if phase is pause, the duration of pause is drawn at random, uniformly on the interval [0,100].
<p>
The routing protocol is DSR. There are 20 data connections, each with a fixed packet send rate of 1 pkt/sec. Packet lengths are fixed to 512 B.
<p>
<b> Default initilization rule </b>: for each mobile, t=0 is a trip transition instant. Initially, each mobile is in move phase. 
<p>
Results with no paussing are similar: see <a href="./index.htm#simpaper">S. PalChaudhuri et al</a>.

<h3> Numerical speed </h3>

The left plot shows numerical speed averaged over all mobiles at time instants spanning [0,5000]. 
The right plots show histograms of mobile speeds at time 1, 100, 1000, and 5000 seconds since the simulation start.

<b>Observations</b>
<ul>
<li> Initially, as t=0 is a trip transition instant, the speed is uniformly distributed on the interval [0.01,9.99]. Therein, its mean is 5.
<li>  The distribution of numerical speed converges to that of unique steady-state distribution, 
which is different than as seen at a trip transition instant. 
<li> <font face="verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif" size="2" color=#FF0000>Visually, it takes more than 2000 seconds to converge ! </font>
</ul>

<h3> Packet delivery ratio </h3>

The plots show packet delivery ratio defined as (# received packets)  /  (#  transmitted packets), which is computed over 10-second intervals, 
averaged over all data connections and averaged over 100 simulation runs.
