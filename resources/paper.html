Writing a paper ? Please check these guidelines. First answer the following quiz.

<h2><a name="quiz">Quiz 1</a></h2><a name="quiz">
<dl>
<dt>Q1
</dt><dd>
<ol>
<li>My readers will carefully read my paper from the first sentence to the
last.
</li><li>My readers will read the abstract carefully and, if interested, will dive into selected portions of the
paper.
</li><li>No one will read my paper anyhow.
</li></ol>
</dd><dt>Q2
</dt><dd>
<ol>
<li>On page 2, I introduce the variable &#964;, and I use it again
on page 13. My readers will remember what &#964; is, otherwise,
why would they read my paper ?
</li><li>On page 2, I introduce the variable &#964;, and I use it again
on page 13. Since it is a long way from the definition to the
next use, I put a list of variables at the end of the paper.
</li><li>No one checks the mathematical formulas anyhow.
</li></ol>
</dd><dt>Q3
</dt><dd>
<ol>
<li>The captions of my figures are terse. I assume my reader will look at the figure exactly when
my text
directs her to do so.
</li><li>My reader may look at the figures before reading all the text, just to get a feeling for the paper.
Therefore I put captions that are as self-contained as
possible.
</li><li>I never put figures. It is a pain to put them into Latex and no one looks at them anyhow.

</li><li>Slides are numbered

</li></ol>
<h2><a name="general">General Guidelines</a></h2><a name="general">
<h3>You write for human beings</h3>
<ol>
<li>Think about your reader. Who is she ? Is she assumed to be an expert in computer networking or not ?
</li><li>Help your reader. Even if your reader is an expert in your field, he is NOT an expert in your work. You have spent the
last months or years working on this project, but your reader has not. Please help your reader get the overall picture
in place quickly. Reading technical papers is hard, is much less fun than
reading novels, so please be kind to your reader (who may be
your reviewer...).
<br>Make it easy to understand whether every point you are making is
<ul>
<li>an assumption
</li><li>a review of existing work
</li><li>your invention
</li></ul>
</li><li>Come to the point quickly. Do not spend your and the reader's time about general purpose introductions. If you are writing a paper
about a congestion control protocol for audio applications, and your target is an IEEE transactions journal or an ACM conference,
do not spend a paragraph explaining why internet telephony is important.
But do not forget to explain what your problem is.

</li></ol>
<h3>Organize the Information you are Delivering</h3>
<p>This is the most difficult part -- if you master the two points below, you are in good shape.
</p><ol>
<li>Define concepts once and at the right place.
<p>Readers expect to find things at the right place. System description, review of state of the art, simulation setup, simulation results are all different things. They should appear in well defined sections, and only once. DO NOT define or explain the same thing twice. This gives a non professional look, and is likely to be inconsistent as your paper evolves.
<br>Don't
</p><blockquote>In Section "Simulation Setup": Nodes periodically broadcast HELLO messages in order for nodes to build their ZRW routing tables. When a HELLO message is sent, the HELLO
timer is reset. The value of the HELLO timer is 1 s
</blockquote>
<br>Do
<blockquote>In Section "3.2.2 Description of Protocol": Nodes periodically broadcast HELLO messages in order for nodes to build their ZRW routing tables. When a HELLO message is sent, the HELLO
timer is reset.
<br>In Section "5.1 Simulation Setup": the HELLO timer (see Section 3.2.2) is equal to 1s
</blockquote>
<br>In a subsection called "Solution Overview", do not give
general considerations about things you left for further study. In a section called "Numerical Results" do not explain the protocol you are simulating. In Section "Protocol Walkthrough" do not justify why you leave some function out of scope.
<p>

</p></li><li>Support Random Access. <p>Many readers, among them reviewers, will jump from figure to figure, or from section to section. Many will read the captions before reading the sections they are in. Be aware of that.
</p><p>Now I hear you say: how can I combine random access without repeating the same thing again and again ? Well, that' s precisely what you shoul target: give enough information for the reader who does random access, but do not repeat the same thing again and again.
</p><p>A figure caption should give enough accurate information, to make random access possible and pleasant to the reader. Do not be afraid to have long captions. In the caption, point to precise locations in the paper where the reader can find all details, if necessary.
<br>Don't
</p><blockquote>(caption of Figure 5). Simulation results for a 500 node network with Pause-Time on the x-axis.
</blockquote>
Your reader may misunderstand which network you are simulating here. She needs a precise definition of the network and the parameter Pause-Time. Otherwise, she may understand something completely different than you think; for example: Figure 5 is about the same network as in Figure 3, but with 500 nodes instead of 100. (In this specific example, the networks in Figures 3 and 5 are not the same; this is clear from the full text -- it should also be clear to a reader who jumps from figure to figure).

<br>Do
 <blockquote>(caption of Figure 5). Simulation results for the network of Figure 4 with 500 nodes. Total throughput versus Pause-Time (defined in Section 6.7.3)
 </blockquote>
<br>
</li></ol>
<p>Here are a few observations to help you reach these two objectives.
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure all notation you use is easily identifiable. If you talk of parameter &#945; at great length in Section 5.3, and &#945; was defined somewhere in the middle of a paragraph in Section 2.3.4, then you have a problem. It will be very hard for a reader to locate the meaning of &#945;. In such a case, list all your global important notation in a table or a very visible paragraph.
</li><li>Avoid using synonyms. Perhaps you were taught in highschool to avoid repetitions and use synonyms. This is nice in a literary text, but not in a technical document. Indeed, one of the major difficulties when reading a paper is to find out exactly what the author means. Synonyms are therefore counter-productive: you never know, when the authors uses two different names, whether she means two different things or not.
<br>Don't
<blockquote>Node A forwards the packet using the fixed address since the destination
is reachable by ZGW.  ... If the
destination is in the ZGW routing table, node A should not use the location information .... When the destination
is in the ZGW reachable area, the TTL field is updated differently ...
</blockquote>
Your reader will wonder: is there a difference between the
three terms "reachable by ZGW", "in the ZGW routing table", "in the ZGW reachable
area". It may be obvious to you that they are the same, but this is probably not so to the reader.
<br>
Do
<blockquote>The node builds its ZGW routing table using the fields heard in the Hello messages.
...Node A forwards the packet using the fixed address since the destination
is in the ZGW routing table.  ... If the
destination is in the ZGW routing table, node A should not use the location information .... When the destination
is in the ZGW routing table, the TTL field is updated differently ...
</blockquote>
Once you introduce a name for an object, stick to it. Accept
the repetitions that this may cause.
</li><li>Give your justifications at the beginning of the paper (for major
justifications) or of the section (for minor justifications). Do *not* give them on the fly, as needed. Once you have
justified a choice, do not justify it again -- this weakens your justification.
<br>Don't
<br> (head of section 5) <blockquote>We study three loss model:
fixed loss probability, time varying loss probability and the Gilbert loss model. The first one discards each
incoming packet with the same probability. The second loss
model provides more variable network conditions where the
packet drop probability alternates between high and low while
the same average drop probability is maintained. The
congestion control protocols frequently have to adjust their
sending rate, putting more emphasis on the transient behavior
of the protocols. The last one produces highly correlated losses.</blockquote>
<br> (subsection 5.3: Performance with Gilbert Model) <blockquote>
The Gilbert loss model is not intended to closely model
realistic network conditions found in
the Internet. It is merely used to analyze how the mechanisms
perform when the assumption of packet loss independence is not
met. The model remains in its current state for a fixed
amount of time, &#964;=10 ms, after which a random
experiment is performed to see whether a state change should
occur.</blockquote>

</li><li>Do not introduce
major building blocks in the middle of the paper.
<br>Don't
<br>In Section 5 (detailed description of the protocol):
 <blockquote>The estimation procedure may be ``stuck" if the source does not have a
 neighbour that has older information than self. This
 happens in irregular topologies. The solution that we adopt to
 solve this problem is proposed in [22] and[23]. The source
 thus computes the weighted sum of increase components and
 applies the following equation...
</blockquote>
<br>Do
<br>
In Section 2 (overview):
 <blockquote>The estimation procedure may be ``stuck" if the source does not have a
 neighbour that has older information than self. This
 happens in irregular topologies. In our protocol, we adopt the solution in [22] and[23].
 </blockquote>
<br>
In Section 5 (detailed description of the protocol):
 <blockquote>As mentioned in Section 2, the source uses at
 this point the recovery procedure defined in [23]. It computes the weighted sum of increase components and
 applies the following equation...
 </blockquote>
</li><li>Give all your assumptions at the beginning of the paper.
Do NOT introduce them one by one, as you need them.

</li></ul>
<h3>Be Scientific</h3><ol>
<li>Use the scientific method to draw conclusions. The scientific method means that you do not draw a conclusion before verifying what you are going to say; in short:
<pre>        do
           {define hypothesis; design experiments; validate }
        until (validation is OK)
</pre>
<br>Don't
 <blockquote>(In Section "Simulation Results"): The normalized routing load is shown in Figure 4.
We see that protocol B has much less overhead than protocol A. Protocol A
frequently uses flooding as a means to build or repair broken
routes, which causes a large overhead.
 </blockquote>
 The flaw is that you <i>interpret</i> Figure 4 when you say that protocol A has more overhead because it
 uses flooding. The only thing the figure says is that protocol A has more overhead. Your interpretation may be right (it might also be wrong, for example the larger overhead might be due to the setting of a Hello timer). The only thing we can say is that the figure leads you to pose as <i>hypothesis</i> that protocol A has large overhead due to flooding. The next step is to design an experiment that will confirm, or infirm that hypothesis.
<br>Do
 <blockquote>(In Section "Simulation Results"): The normalized routing load is shown in Figure 4.
We see that protocol B has much less overhead than protocol A. Protocol A
frequently uses flooding as a means to build or repair broken
routes. We pose as hypothesis that this might be the cause of this large difference. To test this hypothesis, we designed the following experiment. We measured the performance of protocol A after setting the flooding frequency parameter to a high value. We used a low mobility scenario where route breaks are rare. Figure 5 shows that the routing overhead of A and B are now comparable, which confirms our hypothesis.
 </blockquote>
 </li><li>All simulation parameters are described and their values are given. It should be possible for an independent researcher to reproduce your results. Put your simulation code on the web.
</li><li>There are no ambiguities. All graphs and tables have units. If you use the word "billion", say whether is 9 or 12 zeroes.
</li><li>Make sure you spend enough time to scan the literature and are aware of the state of the art. You must incorporate in your state of the art the findings published in IEEE and ACM journals and conferences -- ignoring a single paper there may be fatal. Also use Citeseer, the Web of Science... and Google.
<p>Your reference list should be up-to-date. Many reviewers will fist look at your list of references to see if you are up to date. If an important reference is missing, your paper is probably already rejected.

</p></li></ol>
<h2>Make an Abstract</h2>
The research is done, you now want to finalize your findings
in a paper. The first step is to do an abstract. If you
succeed, go ahead with writing the paper. Else, you probably
want to do some more research.
<p>The abstract should contain the following parts.
</p><ol>
<li>What is the problem ?
</li><li>Why is it a problem ?
</li><li>Why is it important to solve it ?
</li><li>Give your main findings, the ones you want people to
remember.
</li></ol>
<h2>Make A Production Plan</h2>
The abstract is done, you now want to finalize your paper.
<ol>
<li>Make a rough time plan. Estimate when you have completed
what. This seems magical, and when you do this for the first
time, you may find that it is non-sense to make a time plan
when everything is so uncertain. But when you have more
experience, you will be surprised to see that it is possible
to do a time plan. The time plan serves two goals:
<ul>
<li>reduce your stress: By defining smaller pieces, you see
progress and you gain confidence.
</li><li>set priorities: With a time plan you become aware of where
you spend time and of what you can and cannot achieve.
</li></ul>
A time plan is not a strict schedule. You need to adjust
it at least once a week. It evolves as
difficulties arise (most frequent case) or when the job is
easier than expected (less frequent case). You may wonder: why
bother keeping track of a moving time plan ? Well, this is
precisely for keeping track. This will help you decide about
your paper, rather than let things decide for you.
</li><li>Emergency costs time. If you have a strict deadline (call for paper) then put
some BUFFER in your time plan. Plan to deliver the paper 3 days before the deadline. It is unwise
to believe that your paper is more competitive because you worked on it until the last second.
Delivering the paper in advance will leave you relaxed, and this will feel in the
paper. You will avoid wasting time due to a busy upload
server, incompatible fonts, network outages, snow storms, hard
disk crashes, last minute emergency with your TA duties, etc.
</li><li>Plan for a final pass (see below).
</li></ol>
<h2>Write the Paper</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do a MAP, containing all the ideas and points you want to
make
</li><li>Now write a sketch. It contains the contents of all sections in a few words.
Try a structure ( = break the story into several pieces).
Do not worry too much about section sizes at this point, you
will tune this later.
</li><li>One section, or part of section, is the state of the art.
Be very careful about that one -- a deficient state of the art
accounts for a large fraction
of rejected papers.
</li><li>Write the sections. This will take you many days. You will
have to iterate on the previous points.
</li><li>Write the conclusion. The conclusion should not bring any
new piece of information about your current work, it should
only summarize, or put in a different perspective, some
elements which were explained earlier in the paper. You may
additionally open up to areas of interest, or related problems
that you intend to tackle (but will you really ?).
</li><li>Write the introduction. The introduction should explain
the same points as the abstract, with more details. If the
state of the art is not too long, put it in the introduction,
else in a section of its own.
</li></ol>
<h2>Style</h2>
Now it is time to think of your writing style.
</a><ol><a name="general">
<li>Introduce one point per sentence, not more. Break
sentences into several, if needed.
<br>
Don't
<br>
<blockquote>
We prove that, in the limit of infinite power, the fairness
index tends to 0.
We verify numerically, on a large number of random
networks, that unfairness does occur with realistic power
constraints, which is a generalization of results from
[ZGOMO] saying again that this unfairness property
is not a problem of UWB but rather of the performance metric.
</blockquote>
<br>
The last sentence makes two points: (1) the unfairness that occurs at the limit
also exists in reality (2) the problem
reported in [ZGOMO] is explained by this general result. Do
<br>
<blockquote>

index tends to 0.
We verify numerically, on a large number of random
networks, that unfairness does occur with realistic power
constraints. This generalizes the problem reported in
[ZGOMO] and shows that
is not a problem of UWB but rather of the performance metric.
</blockquote>
</li><li>Streamline your sentences: remove unnecessary words. Replace
<blockquote>
When the ZMRP mechanism is employed, nodes send only one
message per round. We have that the cost per round is XY/2.
</blockquote>
by
<blockquote>
With ZMRP, nodes send only one
message per round. The cost per round is XY/2.
</blockquote>Avoid contorted expressions. Replace
<blockquote>
We can observe that protocol B greatly reduces routing overhead compared to protocol A.</blockquote>
by
<blockquote>Protocol B has much less routing overhead than protocol A.</blockquote>
</li></a><li><a name="general">Also see Henning's Schulzrinne's
</a><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-bugs.html"> recommendations</a>, but do not follow his recommendations on inline enumeration and bullets.
</li></ol>
<h2>Final Pass: Remove</h2>
You have written your paper, or at least you believe so. Well,
you now need a final pass. The goal is now to REMOVE things
that are not needed.
<ol>
<li>Be critical, see your work with the eyes of an external
reviewer: is everything you are writing in the paper really
interesting ?

</li></ol>
<h2>Slides and Posters</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why do you give a talk ? People can have your paper in the proceedings, so you must add value to reading the paper. At the end of your talk, the audience should have learnt something, even if they never read the paper in detail.
</li><li>The two big mistakes are
<ul>
<li>Too superficial: you explain at great length why you do your stuff, why it is great, etc, but at the end the audience does not have much more information than by reading the abstract of your paper.
</li><li>You lost your audience: because you do not have time to explain all aspects of your paper in detail, you quickly throw at people an indigestible list of concepts and equations that no one understands. You think you impress your audience in this way, but you don't.
</li></ul>
In both cases you are boring.
</li><li>To avoid both mistakes, you have to make a choice of which aspects you want to explain in detail. Then do explain them in detail, and position them with respect to the big picture. Plan your time carefully. In general, count 1.5 - 2 mn per slide.
</li><li>Explain by example. The human brain is not a Turing machine; we learn more easily by example and imitation. If you have defined a complex, smart protocol, imagine a small number of well chosen scenarios, which can illustrate all the beauty of your concepts, and explain how the mechanisms work on these scenarios.
</li><li>However, do not explain only by example. Also give the global picture. This gives the audience the warm feeling that there <i>is</i> a global picture.
</li><li>If you show an equation, make sure the audience will have enough time and information on the slide to understand it. Otherwise, why do you show it ? (do not do mathematical intimidation). Displaying equations in a slide show is like showing love scenes in a movie -- you can do it, but be careful and do not abuse...
</li><li>You think that since you have defined parameter x in slide 2, the audience will remember at slide 25 what x stands for. Well, you are probably wrong. Do not assume that your audience will have in mind the complete list of parameters that you defined in the paper.
</li><li>Use the right tool. The tool influences your slide show.
<p>Make sure you master <i>both</i> Latex and Powerpoint or equivalent. Only then you will be able to decide which tool is the best.

</p><p>In general, you tend to not do enough pictures.

</p><p><del>Do not waste your time writing equations in Powerpoint -- instead, cut and paste equations from the pdf or ps of the paper that you have already written (with Latex), or even better, use TexPoint.</del> Use the newer powerpoint equation editor, which uses the Latex syntax.
